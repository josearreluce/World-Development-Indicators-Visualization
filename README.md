# Indicators in World Development Project
This is a data visualization project built using React and Yarn meant to
display/show differences in the levels of development in different countries throughout the world throughout a range of time.

## Getting Started


```sh
yarn

yarn start
```

The default configuration opens a port on http://localhost:3001/, so simply
point a browser to that address and you'll be up and running.
